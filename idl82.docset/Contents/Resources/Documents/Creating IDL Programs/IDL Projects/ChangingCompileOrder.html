   IDL Compile Order
  </h1>
  <p>
   To display the IDL Compile Order page, right click on a project in the
   <b>
    Project Explorer
   </b>
   , select
   <b>
    Properties
   </b>
   , then in the Properties dialog, select the
   <b>
    IDL Compile Order
   </b>
   page.
  </p>
  <h2 class="API">
   Changing the Compile Order and Excluding Files from the Build
  </h2>
  <p>
   Although you can have any number of files physically residing in your project folder, you do not have to include all of those files in the project build. For the subset of files you do want to include, you can choose the order in which they are compiled. In certain circumstances, the file build order can determine the success or failure of the build (see
   <a href="ProjectBuildConcepts.html">
    Building IDL Projects
   </a>
   ).
  </p>
  <p>
   Including or excluding files from the project build means flipping a build exclusion value that is attached to the file. You can do this on the IDL Compile Order page of the
   <b>
    Project Properties
   </b>
   dialog  or by selecting a file in the Project Explorer and in the context menu selecting
   <b>
    Toggle Exclude from Build
   </b>
   .
  </p>
  <h2 class="API">
   The IDL Compile Order Page
  </h2>
  <p>
   The project’s PRO and SAVE files are displayed in a list. A check next to the file means that the file is included in the build, and an unselected file is excluded from the build. For long file lists, you can save time by using the
   <b>
    Select All
   </b>
   and
   <b>
    Deselect All
   </b>
   buttons.
  </p>
  <p>
   Toggling a file’s inclusion status on the
   <b>
    IDL Compile Order
   </b>
   page changes the file’s icon in the Workbench Project Explorer. Files excluded from the project build are marked by a crossed circle:
  </p>
  <p class="Note" madcap:autonum="&lt;b&gt;Note: &lt;/b&gt;">
   <span class="autonumber">
    <span>
     <b>
      Note:
     </b>
    </span>
   </span>
   The SAVE file generated by the build process (specified on the
   <a href="IDLBuildProperties.html">
    IDL Build Properties
   </a>
   page) is not displayed in this list.
  </p>
  <h2 class="API">
   How Files Are Ordered in the List
  </h2>
  <p>
   The first time the Compile Order page is displayed for a particular project, all PRO and SAVE files within the project are listed in alphabetical order.
  </p>
  <p>
   After the project compile order has been modified and saved, new files are added to the bottom of the list, in alphabetical order.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a project is built before any changes have been saved on the
   <b>
    IDL Compile Order
   </b>
   page, the files will be compiled or restored in alphabetical order. If the compile order is set, and files are added to the project without also editing the compile order, the new files will be compiled in alphabetical order, after all of the other project files have been compiled or restored.
  </p>
  <h2 class="API">
   Moving Files in the List
  </h2>
  <p>
   To change the compile order of the project, select a file (only one file may be selected at a time) and use the Move buttons on the right-hand side of the page to move the file up or down in the list.
