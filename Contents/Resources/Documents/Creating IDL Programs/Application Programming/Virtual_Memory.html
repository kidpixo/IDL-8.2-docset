   Virtual Memory

   Virtual memory allows the computer to execute programs that require more memory than is actually present in the machine by keeping those portions of programs and data that are not being used on the disk. Although this process is transparent to the user, it greatly affects the efficiency of the program.

   In relatively modern computers, plentiful physical memory (hundreds of megabytes for a single-use machine) is not uncommon. Remember, however, that IDL is generally not the only consumer of memory on a system. Other applications, the operating system itself, and other users on multi-user systems may consume large amounts of physical and virtual memory. If your IDL program appears to be inefficient or slow, inspect the system memory situation to determine whether virtual memory is being used, and if so, whether there is enough of it.
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   arrays are stored in dynamically allocated memory. Although the program can address large amounts of data, only a small portion of that data actually resides in physical memory at any given moment; the remainder is stored on disk. The portion of data and program code in real physical memory is commonly called the working set.
  </p>
  <p>
   When an attempt is made to access data in virtual memory not currently residing in physical memory, the operating system suspends
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   , arranges for the page of memory containing the datum to be moved into physical memory and then allows
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   to continue. This process involves deciding where the datum should go in memory, writing the current contents of the selected memory page out to the disk, and reading the page with the datum into the selected memory page. A
   <i>
    page fault
   </i>
   is said to occur each time this process takes place. Because the time required to read from or write to the disk is very large in relation to the physical memory access time, page faults become an important consideration.
  </p>
  <p>
   When using
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   with large arrays, it is important to have access to sufficient physical and virtual memory. Given a suitable amount of physical memory, the parameters that regulate virtual memory require adjustment to assure best performance. These parameters are discussed below. See

   Access Large Arrays by Memory Order
  </h2>
  <p>
   When an array is larger than or close to the working set size (i.e., the amount of physical memory available for the process), it is preferable to access it in memory address order.
  </p>
  <p>
   Consider the process of transposing a large array. Assume the array is a 512 ∞ 512 byte image with a 100 kilobyte working set. The array requires 512 ∞ 512, or approximately 250 kilobytes. Less than half of the image can be in memory at any one instant.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the transpose operation, each row must be interchanged with the corresponding column. The first row, containing the first 512 bytes of the image, will be read into memory, if necessary, and written to the first column. Because arrays are stored in row order (the first subscript varies the fastest), one column of the image spans a range of addresses almost equal to the size of the entire image. To write the first column, 250,000 bytes of data must be read into physical memory, updated, and written back to the disk. This process must be repeated for each column, requiring the entire array be read and written almost 512 times. The amount of time required to transpose the array using the method described above is relatively large.
  </p>
  <p>
   In contrast, the
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL

    TRANSPOSE
   </a>
   function transposes large arrays by dividing them into subarrays smaller than the working set size enabling it to transpose a 512 ∞ 512 image in a much smaller amount of time.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Example
  </h3>
  <p>
   Consider the operation of the following
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   statement:
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   FOR X = 0, 511 DO FOR Y = 0, 511 DO ARR[X, Y] = ...
  </p>
  <p>
   This statement requires an extremely large execution time because the entire array must be transferred between memory and the disk 512 times. The proper form of the statement is to process the points in address order by using the following statement:
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   FOR Y = 0, 511 DO FOR X = 0, 511 DO ARR[X, Y] = ...
  </p>
  <p>
   This approach cuts computing time by a factor of at least 50.

   Running Out of Virtual Memory
  </h2>
  <p>
   If you process large images with
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   and use the vendor-supplied default system parameters (especially if you have a small system), you may encounter the error message
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   % Unable to allocate memory.
  </p>
  <p>
   This error message means that
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   was unable to obtain enough virtual memory to hold all your data. Whenever you define an array, image, or vector,
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   asks the operating system for some virtual memory in which to store the data. When you reassign the variable,
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   frees the memory for re-use.
  </p>
  <p>
   The first time you get this error, you will either have to stop what you are doing and exit
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   or delete unused variables containing images or arrays, thereby releasing enough virtual memory to continue. You can delete the memory allocation of array variables by setting the variable equal to a scalar value.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you need to exit
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   , you first should use the SAVE procedure to save your variables in an
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   save file. Later, you will be able to recover those variables from the save file using the RESTORE procedure.
  </p>
  <p>
   The HELP,/MEMORY command tells you how much virtual memory you have allocated. For example, a 512&#160;∞&#160;512 complex floating array requires 8&#160;∞&#160;512
   <sup>
    2
   </sup>
   bytes or about 2 megabytes of memory because each complex element requires 8 bytes. Deleting a variable containing a 512 ∞ 512 complex array will increase the amount of memory available by this amount.

   Minimizing Virtual Memory
  </h2>
  <p>
   If virtual memory is a problem, try to tailor your programming to minimize the number of images held in
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   variables. Keep in mind that
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   creates temporary arrays to evaluate expressions involving arrays. For example, when evaluating the statement
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   A = (B + C) * (E + F)
  </p>
  <p>
   <span class="DocumentTitleProductName">
    IDL
   </span>
   first evaluates the expression B + C and creates a temporary array if either B or C are arrays. In the same manner, another temporary array is created if either E or F are arrays. Finally, the result is computed, the previous contents of A are deleted, and the temporary area holding the result is saved as variable A. Therefore, during the evaluation of this statement, enough virtual memory to hold two arrays’ worth of data is required in addition to normal variable storage.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is a good idea to delete the allocation of a variable that contains an image and that appears on the left side of an assignment statement, as shown in the following program.
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ;Loop to process an image.
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   FOR I = ... DO BEGIN
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   &#160;
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ;Processing steps.
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ...
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   &#160;
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ;Delete old allocation for A.
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   A = 0
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   &#160;
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ;Compute image expression and store.
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   A = Image_Expression
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   &#160;
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ...
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   &#160;
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ;End of loop.
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   ENDFOR
  </p>
  <p>
   The purpose of the statement A=0 is to free the old memory allocation for the variable A before computing the image expression in the next statement. Because the old value of A is going to be replaced in the next statement, it makes sense to free A’s allocation first.

   TEMPORARY Function
  </h2>
  <p>
   Another way to minimize memory use when performing operations on large arrays is to use the
   <a class="MCXref_Heading_0" href="../../Reference Material/T/TEMPORARY.html#T_809226861_141045">
    TEMPORARY
   </a>
   function. TEMPORARY returns the value of its argument as a temporary variable and makes the argument undefined. In this way, you avoid making a new copy of temporary results. For example, assume that A is a large array. To add 1 to each element in A, you could enter:
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   A = A+1
  </p>
  <p>
   However, this statement creates a new array for the result of the addition and assigns the result to A
   <i>
    before
   </i>
   freeing the old allocation of A. Hence, the total storage required for the operation is twice the size of A. The statement:
  </p>
  <p class="Code">
   A = TEMPORARY(A) + 1
  </p>
  <p>
   requires no additional space.

   Memory System Parameters
  </h2>
  <p>
   The first step is to determine how much virtual memory you require. For example, if you compute complex Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) on 512 ∞ 512 images, each complex image requires 2 megabytes. Suppose that during a typical session you need to have twenty images stored in variables and require enough memory for ten images to hold temporary results, resulting in a total of thirty images or 60 megabytes. Rounding up to 80 megabytes gives a reasonable value for the amount of physical and virtual memory that should be available to IDL.

  <h4>
   UNIX Virtual Memory
  </h4>
  <p>
   For UNIX, The size of the swapping area(s) determines how much virtual memory your process is allowed. To increase the amount of available virtual memory, you must increase the size of the swap device (sometimes called the swap partition). Increasing the size of a swap partition is a time-consuming task that should be planned carefully. It usually requires saving the contents of the disk, reformatting the disk with the new file partition sizes, and restoring the original contents.Some systems offer the alternative of swapping to a regular file. This is a considerably easier solution, although it may not be as efficient. Consult your system documentation for details and instructions on how to perform these operations.
  </p>
  <h4>
   Windows Virtual Memory
  </h4>
  <p>
   For Microsoft Windows, creation and management of virtual memory files (called “paging files”) are handled more or less automatically. You can, however, adjust the initial and maximum size of the paging file for a given disk. Consult your system documentation for details and instructions on how to perform these operations.
